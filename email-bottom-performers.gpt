Find the key contact person from 'key-contacts.csv' that match the locations in 'bottom-performers.txt'. Tell me their names and email addresses.

For each key contact person we have identified, draft an email to them. The email should be personalized with their name and include a summary of the promotions that can be found in the file called 'summary.txt', as well as metrics from bottom-performers-by-product.txt that pertain to their location.

Write these emails to a file called email-draft.txt and remember to include the recipient's email address.
