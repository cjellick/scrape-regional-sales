For each unique location in 'bottom-performers.csv', find the key contact person from 'key-contacts.csv'. Tell me their name and email address.

For each key contact person we have identified, draft an email to them. The email should be personalized with their name and include a summary of the promotions that can be found in the file called 'summary.txt', as well as metrics from bottom-performers-by-product.csv that pertain to their location.
